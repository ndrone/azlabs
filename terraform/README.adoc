To use Terraform with Azure. You will need to export the following variables.
[source,bash]
----
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="xxx"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="xxx"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="xxx"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="xxx"
----
In this directory I created `.env` with the above so that I can source it into the CLI with
`. ./.env`.
